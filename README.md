# ActiveCurrency

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/sunny/active_currency.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/sunny/active_currency)

Rails plugin to retrieve and store the currency rates daily to integrate
with the `money-rails` gem.

## Rationale

Storing the current currency rates in the database using ActiveCurrency
provides the following advantages:

- Lets you query for the currency rate you actually used in your application at
  any given time.
- Does not need to call an API to get the rates when starting or restarting
  your web server.
- Choose how often you want to update the currency rates (daily for example).
- Your users do not suffer the cost of making calls to the bank rates API.
- Your app does not go down when the bank rates API does.

To fetch the rates, it uses the [eu_central_bank] gem and uses your application
cache when getting the current rate in order to save on database queries.

## Usage

Store the current rate regularly by calling in a scheduled job (using something
like `sidekiq-scheduler`, `whenever`, or `active_scheduler`) with the currencies
you want to store:

```rb
ActiveCurrency::AddRates.call(%w[EUR USD])
```

You can then exchange money by using the Money gem helpers:

```rb
10.to_money('EUR').exchange_to('USD').cents
```

If you need to look up the previous currency rates:

```rb
ActiveCurrency::Rate.value_for('EUR', 'USD', 1.month.ago)
# => 1.151
ActiveCurrency::Rate.where(from: 'EUR', to: 'USD').pluck(:value)
# => [1.162, 1.162, 1.161, 1.161, 1.163, â€¦]
```

## Installation

Add these lines to your application's `Gemfile`:

```rb
# Store and retrieve the currency from the database.
gem 'active_currency'
```

And in `config/initializers/money.rb`:

```rb
MoneyRails.configure do |config|
  config.default_bank = ActiveCurrency::Bank.new
end
```

Then call `bin/rake db:migrate` to create the table that holds
the currency rates and fill it for the first time.

## Tests

In your app test suite you may not want to have to fill your database to be
able to exchange currencies.

For that, you can use a fake rate store in your `rails_helper.rb`:

```rb
MoneyRails.configure do |config|
  rate_store = Money::RatesStore::Memory.new.tap do |store|
    store.add_rate('USD', 'EUR', 1.5)
    store.add_rate('EUR', 'USD', 1.4)
  end
  config.default_bank = Money::Bank::VariableExchange.new(rate_store)
end
```
